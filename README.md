# Modeling NFL Overtime with Markov Chains (2021)

In recent years, the National Football League has come
under fire for the way in which it conducts overtime, as, in
the current NFL overtime system, it seems as if the team
who possesses the ball first wins more often than not. This
is due to a rule which declares the team that scores the first
touchdown is the winner of the game (even if only one team
has had possession). NCAA football, on the other hand,
has been praised for its overtime system, as it is believed
to give both teams a fair chance of winning. 

Modeling both systems with Markov chains yielded that the most likely outcome in NFL overtime was the team that possessed the ball first winning, and that both teams were in fact equally likely to win in NCAA overtime. All analysis and results can be found in the paper and poster presentation in this repository.
